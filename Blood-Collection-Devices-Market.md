High costs associated with automated blood collection devices can be prohibitive, especially for small healthcare facilities with budget constraints. The expensive acquisition and maintenance costs are the major barriers inhibiting the adoption of automated devices. This may hamper the overall market progression.

The report identifies increasing demand for apheresis as a major opportunity. Apheresis enables separation of blood components like plasma, platelets, and RBCs for therapeutic applications. The rising prevalence of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and other chronic conditions requiring accurate blood component collection for treatment is propelling the market demand. Furthermore, growing public awareness regarding the benefits of blood component separation procedures augments segmental growth.

Hospitals, ASCs, and nursing homes accounted for the biggest market share due to escalating incidence of infectious diseases, trauma cases, C-sections, organ transplants, etc. demanding blood collection tools. Meanwhile, clinical laboratories also marked significant adoption owing to the rising number of blood tests.
